A pet project I am building for myself, with the hope that my fellow backcountry skiers/boarders will appreciate. Every time I would go on a ski tour here in SLC, I'd have to check 4-5 websites in the morning to get all of my last checks done. The goal here is to turn those 4-5 get requets into one :) with a simple & small enough single page ui to make this something folks pull out thorughout the day and use as a reference and resource. The swiss army knife of snow saftey information. 

TLDR: I built this to help my fellow backcountry travelers get all of the morning-of information they need in one place. 



For now this will be focused on the central Wasatch (SLC) as that is where I'll be skiing and it is also where there will be the most positive effect as it is the most used zone. I will build out other zones, and once iteration one is complete, I invite others to go for it to address the other areas. I am new to Utah and I know LCC and BCC well enough to construct a good dataset, but I would really struggle elsewhere. Please contact me if you'd like to set up your backyard zone.
